        - HTML Entities 
-->
<p>
The 
<!-- <hr>  -->hr
HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements:
for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
<br>
The hr element can be displayed using different styles, such as a horizontal line, a dotted
line, or a dashed line. The style of the line can be specified using the style attribute.

<hr>

The term "HTML Entity" is used as a synonym for a character reference — 
a pattern of characters that can represent another character in the HTML. 
For example, lt 
<!-- &lt;  -->
is used to represent the less-than symbol (<) in HTML content.
